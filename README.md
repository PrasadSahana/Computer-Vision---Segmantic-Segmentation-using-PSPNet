Computer Vision - Segmantic Segmentation using PSPNet


This paper explains the task of computer vision which is mainly the detection of objects and segmenting the 
objects which we captured using the depth camera. The detailed explanation and analysis are also included in the paper.
The breakthrough progress is achieved by Deep Learning in sematic segmentation. Semantic Segmentation plays a vital role in 
understanding the machine images. For unrestricted and discrete scene, it is very challenging to do scene parsing. 
In our paper we will explain what global context information is capable along with pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet). 
For predicting pixel level information PSPNet provide a very good framework. On various dataset state-of-the-art is performed by the proposed approach.
